# Cybersecurity Attack Classification Using Random Forest

## Project Overview
This repository documents a machine learning workflow for detecting malicious network activity. Using a labeled dataset of network connection attributes, the project compares normal traffic with several cyberattack categories and trains a Random Forest classifier to predict the attack type. The work is presented through an exploratory notebook that covers data understanding, preprocessing, model development, and interpretation.

## Dataset
- **Source:** `assets/cyber_attacks.csv`
- **Observations:** Network connection records labeled as `Botnet`, `Normal`, `DDoS`, `Phishing`, or `PortScan`.
- **Features:** Protocol category, connection duration, traffic volume (`src_bytes`, `dst_bytes`), packet counts, and connection counts.
- **Target:** `attack_type`

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Visual inspection of feature distributions and class balance.
   - Pair plots and correlation heatmaps to identify separability among attack types.
2. **Data Preparation**
   - Handling missing values with `SimpleImputer`.
   - Scaling continuous variables with `StandardScaler`.
   - One-hot encoding of categorical features via a `ColumnTransformer`.
   - Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE oversampling on the training split.
3. **Modeling**
   - Random Forest classifier with 200 trees, balanced class weights, maximum depth of 15, and minimum split size of 5.
   - Pipeline orchestration through `imblearn` to ensure preprocessing, resampling, and modeling steps remain synchronized.
4. **Evaluation**
   - Stratified train/test split (70/30).
  - Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrix analysis per class.
   - Feature-importance diagnostics to interpret which signals drive predictions.

## Key Findings
- DDoS activity is strongly characterized by large byte transfers and extended durations, which the model captures effectively.
- Normal and Botnet traffic exhibit overlapping signatures, highlighting the need for additional behavioral features or temporal context.
- Port scanning events are short-lived with distinctive traffic patterns, aiding separability after scaling.
- Protocol type alone has limited discriminative power; interaction with other features improves performance.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or later
- Recommended packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Running the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```
1. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the exploratory analysis, preprocessing pipeline, model training, and evaluation.
2. Regenerate supporting figures (pair plots, feature importance charts, decision tree visualizations) by running the relevant sections.

## Results
- The Random Forest achieves strong recall on high-volume attacks such as DDoS and PortScan, while performance on Normal vs. Botnet traffic is comparatively lower because of overlapping feature distributions.
- Evaluation outputs (classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance rankings) are available in the notebook for detailed inspection.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate temporal or session-level features (e.g., connection frequency, burst patterns).
- Experiment with additional algorithms (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Networks) to benchmark performance.
- Deploy the trained model behind an API endpoint for real-time inference.
- Introduce automated testing and CI workflows to validate pipeline changes.
